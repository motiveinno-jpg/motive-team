    faq1q: "How is Whistle AI different from Alibaba?",
    faq1a: "Alibaba only provides products registered for export, based on self-declaration. Whistle searches the Korean domestic e-commerce market via Naver Shopping and analyzes manufacturer and brand data to identify origin. We also connect you with real factories, not trading companies.",
    faq2q: "How do you search for trending Korean products?",
    faq2a: "We use the Naver Shopping API to search products that Korean consumers are actually buying in real time. These are mostly Korean domestic hit products not listed on B2B export platforms, making them hard to find overseas.",
    faq3q: "How does AI origin verification work?",
    faq3a: "Our system analyzes manufacturer and brand names from Naver Shopping product listings to identify origin indicators. Products with Korean manufacturer names are flagged as 'Korean Manufacturer', while those with Korean brand names are flagged as 'Korean Brand'. For deeper verification, you can request our team to investigate specific products.",
    faq4q: "What's included in the factory contact service?",
    faq4a: "Basic ($200-300): Identify the actual manufacturer, attempt direct contact, and guarantee contact information even if initial contact fails. Premium ($500-700): Meeting coordination, interpretation, sample request handling, and retries until connected.",
    faq5q: "Is there a minimum order quantity (MOQ)?",
    faq5a: "MOQ varies by manufacturer. Whistle-verified products display MOQ on the product page. For Korea Market products, MOQ is negotiated as part of the factory contact service. Many Korean manufacturers accept orders of 100-500 units.",
    faq6q: "Which countries can you ship to?",
    faq6a: "We support sourcing for buyers worldwide. Key markets include China, US, Japan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Russia, Taiwan, Thailand, UAE, and Singapore. Shipping logistics are coordinated on a per-order basis.",
    faq7q: "What is the pricing structure?",
    faq7a: "Non-members get 1 free search. Free sign-up gets +1 search. Starter ($29/mo): 30 searches + 15 inquiries/month. Pro ($89/mo): 200 searches + 50 inquiries + factory contact discount. Enterprise: Contact us (dedicated manager, unlimited). Per-use options: 10 searches $9, report $19, factory contact $200-$700. Sourcing commission: flat $300 under $3K orders, 5-8% above.",
    faq8q: "Can I get samples first?",
    faq8a: "Yes! Sample shipment is included in factory contact and custom sourcing services. Whistle-verified products allow direct sample requests. Sample shipping costs are typically covered by the buyer.",

    faq1q: "Whistle AI는 알리바바와 무엇이 다른가요?",
    faq1a: "알리바바는 수출용으로 등록된 상품만 자체 신고 기반으로 제공합니다. Whistle은 네이버 쇼핑을 통해 한국 내수 이커머스를 검색하고, 제조사·브랜드 데이터를 분석하여 원산지를 식별합니다. 또한 무역상이 아닌 실제 공장과 직접 연결해드립니다.",
    faq2q: "한국 트렌드 제품은 어떻게 검색하나요?",
    faq2a: "네이버 쇼핑 API를 활용하여 한국 소비자들이 실제로 구매하고 있는 상품을 실시간으로 검색합니다. 이 제품들은 대부분 B2B 수출 플랫폼에 등록되지 않은 한국 내수 히트상품으로, 해외에서는 찾기 어려운 제품입니다.",
    faq3q: "AI 원산지 검증은 어떻게 작동하나요?",
    faq3a: "네이버 쇼핑 상품 리스팅의 제조사(maker)와 브랜드 데이터를 분석하여 원산지 지표를 식별합니다. 한국 제조사명이 있는 제품은 '한국 제조사'로, 한국 브랜드명이 있는 제품은 '한국 브랜드'로 표시됩니다. 보다 정밀한 검증이 필요한 경우 Whistle 팀에 개별 제품 조사를 요청하실 수 있습니다.",
    faq4q: "공장 컨택 서비스에는 무엇이 포함되나요?",
    faq4a: "기본($200~300): 실제 제조사를 특정하고, 직접 컨택을 시도하며, 컨택 실패 시에도 연락처 정보를 보장합니다. 프리미엄($500~700): 미팅 조율, 통역, 샘플 요청 대행, 연결될 때까지 재시도를 포함합니다.",
    faq5q: "최소 주문 수량(MOQ)이 있나요?",
    faq5a: "MOQ는 제조사마다 다릅니다. Whistle 인증 제품은 상품 페이지에 MOQ가 표시됩니다. Korea Market 제품은 공장 컨택 서비스의 일환으로 MOQ를 협상합니다. 많은 한국 제조사들이 100~500개 단위 주문을 수락합니다.",
    faq6q: "어느 나라로 배송이 가능한가요?",
    faq6a: "전 세계 바이어를 위한 소싱을 지원합니다. 주요 시장은 중국, 미국, 일본, 홍콩, 베트남, 러시아, 대만, 태국, UAE, 싱가포르입니다. 배송 물류는 건별로 조율됩니다.",
    faq7q: "요금 구조가 어떻게 되나요?",
    faq7a: "비회원 1회, 무료 가입 시 +1회 검색이 증정됩니다. Starter($29/월)는 월 30회 검색+인콰이어리 15건, Pro($89/월)는 월 200회 검색+인콰이어리 50건+공장 컨택 할인입니다. Enterprise는 별도 문의(전담 매니저, 무제한). 건별로도 이용 가능합니다(검색 10회 $9, 리포트 $19, 공장 컨택 $200~$700). 소싱 대행은 주문금액 $3,000 미만 고정 $300, 이상은 5~8% 수수료입니다.",
    faq8q: "먼저 샘플을 받아볼 수 있나요?",
    faq8a: "네! 샘플 발송 대행은 공장 컨택 및 맞춤 소싱 서비스에 포함됩니다. Whistle 인증 제품은 직접 샘플 요청이 가능합니다. 샘플 배송비는 일반적으로 바이어 부담입니다.",
